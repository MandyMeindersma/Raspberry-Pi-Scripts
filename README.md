# Raspberry-Pi-Scripts

Collection of small scripts to play around with hardware projects:
  * `Button.py` reads the input of a button
  * `Rotary-phone.py` reads the input from a circuit on a rotary phone to see what the rotary phone is currently dialing. I have photos and a description of this project on my [personal website](https://www.mandymeindersma.com/)
